# Graduate-Admissions-Prediction
This project analyzes the Jamboree Admissions dataset to identify key factors (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, Research, University Rating) 
influencing graduate admissions. It applies regression models and statistical inference to predict a student's chance of admit and 
derive actionable recommendations.


# 🎓 Graduate Admissions Prediction using Regression Analysis

This project analyzes the **Jamboree Admissions dataset** to identify key factors influencing graduate admissions and builds predictive models to estimate a student’s **chance of admit**.

---

## 📌 Objectives
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, Research, and University Ratings.  
- Apply **data preprocessing** (outlier treatment, scaling, multicollinearity checks).  
- Build and evaluate **Linear Regression & OLS models** to predict admission probability.  
- Derive **actionable insights** for students and institutions.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- **CGPA (0.50) and GRE Score (0.18)** were the strongest predictors of admission chance.  
- Final Model achieved:  
  - **R² = 0.77**  
  - **Adjusted R² = 0.75**  
  - **RMSE ≈ 0.45**
